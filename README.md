# Dad Golf

A real-time, multi-player Stableford scoring app for casual golf rounds. Up to 10 players join a round from their phones, enter scores hole-by-hole, and watch a live leaderboard update as the round progresses.

**Live app:** https://golf-stableford-production.up.railway.app/

## What it does

- **Set up a round** — one player creates a round and picks (or builds) a course
- **Players join** — up to 10 players join via a short room code or shareable link, each entering their name and handicap
- **Score on your phone** — every player enters their own scores for each hole on their own device
- **Stableford scoring** — points are calculated automatically using the player's handicap and the course's stroke index
- **Live leaderboard** — everyone sees the standings update in real time as scores come in
- **Round replay** — post-round summary with full scorecard, leaderboard progression chart, per-player stats, and competition results; browse past rounds via personal history or group pages
- **Hole competitions** — closest-to-pin and longest drive contests on selected holes
- **Community courses** — shared course database with search, star ratings, reviews, and reporting; location autocomplete via Nominatim (OpenStreetMap)
- **Weather** — live weather conditions displayed for the course location
- **Handicap tracker** — track your last 20 rounds and auto-calculate your GA Handicap Index using Australia's World Handicap System; optionally auto-updates when you complete rounds
- **Groups** — create groups, invite members, assign admin/member roles, and track rounds together
- **Schedule rounds** — group admins schedule upcoming rounds (date, time, course); members RSVP (going/maybe/can't); admins start the round and accepted players are added automatically; dedicated Upcoming Rounds page shows all scheduled rounds across groups
- **Calendar integration** — export scheduled rounds to .ics (Apple Calendar), Google Calendar (web link), or Outlook; optional Google Calendar OAuth sync automatically creates/updates/deletes events when you RSVP; subscribable iCal feed URL for auto-sync in any calendar app (Apple Calendar, Google Calendar, Outlook)
- **Activity feed** — see recent activity from your groups (round completions, new members, scheduled rounds, competition wins, handicap changes, badges earned); like and comment on events; privacy controls (private / in group)
- **Achievement badges** — 12 badges across milestones, scoring, social, and competition categories; awarded automatically on round completion; displayed on your profile; user profile page (`/user/:username`) visible to group members
- **Personal stats** — dedicated stats dashboard with Stableford/Strokes toggle, overview cards, scoring distributions, trend charts, par-type breakdowns, course stats, and recent rounds
- **Group stats** — group leaderboard, records, member breakdowns with expandable scoring distributions, course stats, and recent rounds
- **Head to Head** — compare your stats against any opponent; win/loss/draw record, stat comparison, scoring distributions, dual-line trend chart, and round-by-round history
- **Admin dashboard** — view stats, manage users, and monitor activity
- **Dark / light mode** — theme toggle that respects your preference
- **PWA support** — install the app to your home screen for a native feel

## Stableford scoring (the rules we follow)

Stableford gives points per hole based on net score (gross score minus handicap strokes received on that hole):

| Net score vs. par  | Points |
| ------------------ | ------ |
| Albatross (-3)     | 5      |
| Eagle (-2)         | 4      |
| Birdie (-1)        | 3      |
| Par                | 2      |
| Bogey (+1)         | 1      |
| Double bogey worse | 0      |

**Handicap strokes received:**
A player with handicap _H_ receives strokes on the hardest holes first (by stroke index). If `H >= 18`, they get one stroke on every hole, plus an additional stroke on holes with stroke index `<= H - 18`, and so on.

## Tech stack

- **Frontend:** React 18 + Vite + TypeScript, mobile-first responsive layout
- **Backend:** Node.js + Fastify + WebSocket (`@fastify/websocket`)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (requires `DATABASE_URL`)
- **Shared:** `@dad-golf/shared` package with types, Stableford scoring logic, and room code generation
- **Tooling:** ESLint 9 (flat config) + Prettier + strict TypeScript
- **Hosting:** Railway

## Getting started

```bash
# clone
git clone https://github.com/Lachy-Dauth/dad-golf.git
cd dad-golf

# install (auto-builds the shared package)
npm install

# run in dev (server on :3001, client on :5173)
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173. The Vite dev server proxies `/api` and `/ws` to
the backend on `:3001`. Two sample courses are seeded on first run, so you
can create a round immediately.

### Environment variables

| Variable               | Default   | Description                                               |
| ---------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`                 | `3001`    | Server port                                               |
| `HOST`                 | `0.0.0.0` | Server bind address                                       |
| `DATABASE_URL`         | —         | PostgreSQL connection string                              |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD`       | —         | Password for the bootstrapped `admin` user (min 6 chars)  |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`     | —         | Google OAuth client ID (enables Google Calendar sync)     |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | —         | Google OAuth client secret                                |
| `APP_URL`              | —         | Base URL of the app (for OAuth redirect + calendar links) |

### Production build

```bash
npm run build    # builds shared, server, and client
npm run start    # starts the Fastify server (serves the built client too)
```

In production the server serves `client/dist/*` on the same port as the API.

### Code quality

```bash
npm run lint           # ESLint check
npm run lint:fix       # ESLint auto-fix
npm run format:check   # Prettier check
npm run format         # Prettier auto-format
npm test               # Stableford scoring + handicap unit tests
```

### Deploying to Railway

Connect the repo, add a Postgres plugin, set `DATABASE_URL`, generate a
domain. The included `railway.json` and `nixpacks.toml` handle the rest.

### How to use

Every page in the app links to a built-in guide at `/help`, or you can
tap the **?** in the top-right of any screen.
